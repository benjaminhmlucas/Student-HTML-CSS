	<h1>Making Jerky</h1>
	<p>	A few years back I started a jerky contest(first picture) at Elliotborough Minibar called The Jerky Off.  Every years we have 30 or so different types of jerky all handmade by chefs and residents of Charleston.  I like making smoked habanero teryaki beef jerky as well as soy, ginger, garlic beef jerky! Here are a few pictures:</p>

	<h1>What else?!</h1>
	<p>	Not only I have hobbies! I have also been in the food and beverage industry here in Charleston for 18 years. I have worked at many fine establishments in town over the years. Establishments such as EVO Pizzeria, McCradys, Closed for Business, Two Boroughs Larder, and Elliotborough Minibar!
